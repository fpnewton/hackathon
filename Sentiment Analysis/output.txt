Sentence: I will call the Boca Raton store tomorrow.
Sentence: They will be less busy than    today, and the Executive Office staff will be present.
Sentence: I will reference  the date in the registry and the existance of a credit card charge.
Sentence: If all else fails, the holder of the credit card can challenge the  purchase, through the credit card company.
Sentence: Of course, I hope it will not  come to that.
Sentence: If you have the date of the credit card charge, that would help me a  great deal in pursuing this with the store.
Sentence: I will be here until 7:00 PM  tonight and tomorrow from 11:00 AM until 7:00 PM.

Sentence: We did find out that Coila Longyear  purchased the 5 piece place setting through the Boca Raton  Bloomingdale's store.
Sentence: She said her credit card has already been  charged.
Sentence: We are still concerned because Jeff & I have NO record from  Bloomingdales, nor have we received the place setting.
Sentence: Can you please    locate for us an order number & expected ship date so we have some type  of proof in the event that we do not receive this place setting?
Sentence: We did notice that you have adjusted our registry accordingly.
Sentence: Thanks    again for your continued help.

Sentence: I apologize.
Sentence: I missed the fifth piece of the 5-Piece Place Setting.
Sentence: We    do show 5 purchases by Coila Longyear, and four 5-Piece Place Settings    purchased by Andrea Wilmoth.
Sentence: I am pleased you will be able to do some  more research on this situation.
Sentence: If you find that the purchase was  through Bloomingdale's, please let me know what you learn, and I will  resolve any open issues.

Sentence: Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Tony,  I received your message and truly appreciate your efforts.
Sentence: I know you    were the person who helped us figure out the confusion with this  original order and, quite frankly, we're not sure what we would have  done without your help.
Sentence: I am still rather confused about this missing    order & tomorrow, we will check with Jeff's family to see if we can't  find more out ourselves.
Sentence: I couldn't do that with many of our guests but  b/c this is a gift from a family member, we're not too shy about asking.
Sentence: By Sunday when you're back at work, maybe we'll have more information  for you.
Sentence: Also, I believe the order from Coila Longyear was for 5 pieces, not 4.
Sentence: I  believe it was for a single entire place setting.
Sentence: (Andrea Wilmoth's was  for four 5 piece place settings.)
Sentence: Thanks so much,  Stacy  ----- Original Message -----  From: Bloomingdales Registry  Sent: Friday, May 10, 2002 5:03 PM  To: Stacy Heiman  Subject: Re: Missing gift (KMMV63305L0KM)  Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding order #  W.
Sentence: I have just tried to reach you, by telephone,    and left a voicemail message.
Sentence: If the order for the four pieces was made with a Bloomingdale's store, I  can follow up with the store.
Sentence: However, the only clue in our Purchase  List record is that the store notation was made on April 30, 2002.
Sentence: From the store notation, my supervisor believes that Andrea Wilmoth or    Coila Longyear contacted the Boca Raton store, to report having  purchased the four pieces, elsewhere.
Sentence: I have coded this e-mail to reply to my attention.
Sentence: I will be in the  office Sunday through Wednesday, this week.

Sentence: "It's like no other Registry in the World."
Sentence: Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  I just checked the order number referenced in your email against our  records -- this is NOT the order we were asking about.
Sentence: According to our  records, order # W is from Andrea Wilmoth for 4  place settings.
Sentence: Our question, if you read the email we sent, is  pertaining to an order for a FIFTH place setting -- the order was placed  over the phone by Andrea Wilmoth but it was a gift from Coila Longyear,  my fiance's grandmother.
Sentence: Andrea purchased the gift for Coila to assist  Coila.
Sentence: As of right now, we are still missing any record of this order    -- we know from talking to Coila & Andrea that the order was placed  nearly one month ago.
Sentence: Please help us to locate this single place  setting order.

Sentence: Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Hi,  We are writing because we recently learned that a place setting of our    china was ordered over the phone several weeks ago.
Sentence: We never received    any of the china (which we know is backordered), nor a notification of    the order.
Sentence: In addition, our registry was not adjusted.
Sentence: The gift was  from Coila Longyear (Jeff's grandmother) and was probably ordered by  Andrea Wilmoth.
Sentence: Andrea said she ordered it by telephone quite some time  ago.
Sentence: Would you be able to check into this for us?
Sentence: We'd like some type of  written notification so we can track this order & have some type of  proof.

Sentence: They will be less busy than    today, and the Executive Office staff will be present.
Sentence: I will reference  the date in the registry and the existance of a credit card charge.

Sentence: We did find out that Coila Longyear  purchased the 5 piece place setting through the Boca Raton  Bloomingdale's store.
Sentence: She said her credit card has already been  charged.
Sentence: We are still concerned because Jeff & I have NO record from  Bloomingdales, nor have we received the place setting.

Sentence: I apologize.
Sentence: I missed the fifth piece of the 5-Piece Place Setting.
Sentence: We    do show 5 purchases by Coila Longyear, and four 5-Piece Place Settings    purchased by Andrea Wilmoth.
Sentence: I am pleased you will be able to do some  more research on this situation.

Sentence: I know you    were the person who helped us figure out the confusion with this  original order and, quite frankly, we're not sure what we would have  done without your help.
Sentence: I am still rather confused about this missing    order & tomorrow, we will check with Jeff's family to see if we can't  find more out ourselves.
Sentence: I couldn't do that with many of our guests but  b/c this is a gift from a family member, we're not too shy about asking.
Sentence: By Sunday when you're back at work, maybe we'll have more information  for you.
Sentence: Also, I believe the order from Coila Longyear was for 5 pieces, not 4.
Sentence: I  believe it was for a single entire place setting.
Sentence: (Andrea Wilmoth's was  for four 5 piece place settings.)

Sentence: I have just tried to reach you, by telephone,    and left a voicemail message.
Sentence: If the order for the four pieces was made with a Bloomingdale's store, I  can follow up with the store.
Sentence: However, the only clue in our Purchase  List record is that the store notation was made on April 30, 2002.
Sentence: From the store notation, my supervisor believes that Andrea Wilmoth or    Coila Longyear contacted the Boca Raton store, to report having  purchased the four pieces, elsewhere.
Sentence: I have coded this e-mail to reply to my attention.

Sentence: According to our  records, order # W is from Andrea Wilmoth for 4  place settings.
Sentence: Our question, if you read the email we sent, is  pertaining to an order for a FIFTH place setting -- the order was placed  over the phone by Andrea Wilmoth but it was a gift from Coila Longyear,  my fiance's grandmother.
Sentence: Andrea purchased the gift for Coila to assist  Coila.
Sentence: As of right now, we are still missing any record of this order    -- we know from talking to Coila & Andrea that the order was placed  nearly one month ago.

Sentence: I gave my social security number because I did not have my Macy's charge and wanted to charge the items.
Sentence: When I arrived home, a woman had left a  message on my answering maching saying she had my social security number and that I should call her back at a designated telephone number.
Sentence: I tried but her line was busy.
Sentence: This morning the same woman called again and said she was calling about an outstanding balance from Chase Manhatten Bank that I had not paid in the amount of $6,000 and that it was long overdue.
Sentence: I was going to have a lien against me.
Sentence: She continued to say that she was authorized to settle the charge amount and even negotiate a lower amount if I would transfer the balance to another account.
Sentence: She said I should give her the number of another credit card I had and she would take care of that transfer balance.
Sentence: I told her I had already transfered that balance and that according to my records I owed Chase nothing.
Sentence: She kept insisting that I did and that she could take care of it if I acted quickly and gave her the information she needed.
Sentence: I hung up and called Chase Manhatten and they confirmed I owned nothing.
Sentence: To make a long story short, I believe this woman was running a scam.
Sentence: I reported it to the police and they belive that it is possible an employee from Macy's gave out my social security number to the woman running the scam.
Sentence: They will investigate.
Sentence: You may want to do the same.
Sentence: The two counters I was at were the Clinique counter, and the Lagerdahl men's cologne counter.
Sentence: I purchased things at both counters and had to give my social security number at each.

Sentence: Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  To whom it may concern,        My name is Noreen Crinion and I held a registry at Macy's for my  June 9th wedding.
Sentence: Unfortunately,  I received duplicates of several  items.
Sentence: I spoke to my guests and they all assured me that they followed  the proper protocol when purchasing their gifts.
Sentence: As a result I have  received 3 coffee makers and 6 place settings too many!!  Upon review of  my registry I was further dismayed to see that the list still indicates  that I require two more plate sets.
Sentence: Please advise me what steps I must  take to return the excess gifts.
Sentence: I am not sure that I will be able to  obtain receipts for all the products.
Sentence: Furthermore, I am quite  disappointed with the store's registry service.
Sentence: Upon my enrollment I  was assured that this was a highly efficient system.
Sentence: My experiences thus  far indicate the contrary The fact that it is now necessary for me to  transport a large cargo back to the store is quite upsetting.
Sentence: Please  contact me as soon as possible with  instructions as to what i must do  to accomplish the return of the surplus as painlessly as possible  thank you,  Noreen Crinion Delaunay

Sentence: Yesterday, I lugged all of my duplicates to your jersey city store.
Sentence: My   experience there was horrendous to say the least.
Sentence: I was made to wait over   twenty minutes before the manager, Marc Neil, finally deigned to speak with   me.
Sentence: He refused to believe my assertion that my guests did go about the   registry process correctly.
Sentence: He was rude, curt and extremely nasty.
Sentence: He   insinuated that my attempt to return the duplicates was a some kind of   "scam."
Sentence: I cannot comprehend why I should be subjected to that kind of   treatment when I am only trying to make some returns which my original bridal   consultant told me would be painless.
Sentence: What kind of store has Macy's opened   in Jersey City.
Sentence: In fact I believe the jersey city store is the root of my   problem.
Sentence: Perhaps because it is a new store the employees have not been   trained in how to remove items from the registry.
Sentence: The two extra coffee pots   and eight extra place settings (purchased by my grandmother) were all   obtained in that store.
Sentence: Each of my friends are positive they told the clerk   they were gifts from the registry and even gave them a copy of the list at   check out.
Sentence: I was upset when I discovered this mix up had occurred.
Sentence: I am now   furious at the way it is being handled on Macy's side.
Sentence: I have been trying to   contact my guest for copies of their receipts but many of my guests were from   Europe and out of town and it is difficult to reach them.
Sentence: One thing I am   positive of however is that I will never be returning to your jersey city   store, if any Macy's again.
Sentence: What right does that man ( Marc Neil) have to   treat me with disdain as I try to return some gifts.
Sentence: His hostility is an   even bigger slap in the face considering the fact that just prior to my   "conversation" with him I made a payment of 440 dollars to my Macy's credit   card which should have indicated that I was a valued customer who should have   been treated accordingly.
Sentence: I have six friends who are planning to marry within the next year, some   who already have registries with your store.
Sentence: I will be advising them to not   continue with Macy's after my experience.
Sentence: PLEASE, advise me how I may return these products!
Sentence: When I made my   registry I was told that duplicate items on the list could easily be returned   without receipts.
Sentence: Can I do this by mail?
Sentence: Marc Neil offered me 29.99 for a   coffee maker whose retail price is 69.99 and whose CURRENT store sale price   is 49.99
Sentence: I am content to accept the sail price but not a value of 29.99 that is more   then half of what my guest paid.
Sentence: As to Internet sales, I had one.
Sentence: Two sage place settings were sent to me   by Han Rae chang.
Sentence: This was the first gift i received.
Sentence: if necessary can i   mail this back.
Sentence: thank you  Noreen Crinion Delaunay  p. s if you are not the correct person could you forward this to someone who   might be able to assist me.

Sentence: Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Form Message  ml_subject: General Question/Other  Comment: To Whom it May Concern:  My husband purchased a Tag Heuer watch for me to celebrate the birth of  our second child.
Sentence: I returned to Macy's to get the watch sized and they  refused to size the watch.
Sentence: I had to bring my watch to another retailer  and pay to get the watch sized after we had already spent over $1000 at  Macy's.
Sentence: Come to find out they were unable to size the watch to me.
Sentence: I    was inbetween links and this watch did not have the capacity for smaller  sizing.
Sentence: Because the watch was ill fitting we attempted to return the  watch.
Sentence: We have been to 2 Macy's stores and spoke to managers and they    refuse to allow us to return the watch as it was over 30 days.
Sentence: Unfortunately since I had a new baby to care for and had to go to  another store to get the watch sized it took us more than 30 days to  determine the watch was ill fitting and needed to be returned.
Sentence: We are    very unhappy with the Macy's customer service we have received.
Sentence: First  the refusal to size the watch after a large purchase and then the  refusal to return the watch.
Sentence: We have been Macy's card holders for  sometime.
Sentence: In fact I purchased a Tag Heuer watch for my husband a few  years ago and had great customer service - they sized his watch on the    spot without a problem.
Sentence: I would like to return this watch for a store    credit.
Sentence: I plan on buying a Swiss Army watch that I know has the  capacity for additional sizing besides removing links.
Sentence: Please advise on  how we should proceed with this matter.

Sentence: I spent 3 hours in the Hyannis, MA store today, and I am saddened and disgusted at the Macy's policy of selling clothing and other items which are manufactured in Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and other Mid-East countries that provide money to terrorists.

Sentence: I am just in shock about this cashier that you have working for you I felt compelled to tell you what happened.
Sentence: I was in the home section and went on line about 9:pm on July 17 with my sister to purchase two boxes of dinnerware.
Sentence: When we got to the line there was two people ahead of me and I could tell right away that the cashier was not happy.
Sentence: The customer on line asked the cashier how much his item rung up and then informed the cashier that it wrung up incorrectly.
Sentence: The cashier was starting to walk away to check the price and then turned to the line (us) and said "no one better aggrevaite me or I will walk off" and then procedded to get the correct price.
Sentence: The man was so upset he followed the cashier to where he was and was talking to him about what he just said.
Sentence: I was in shock and if I did not really need these plates I would have dropped them and left.
Sentence: By the time I got to the register, he scanned my plates and of cours they rung up incorrectly as well.
Sentence: I informed him there was a sign stating a lower price and he said to me "go get the sign and hurry up"  I looked at my sister in complete shock.
Sentence: I do not work for Macy's and it is not my fault that this rung up incorrectly.
Sentence: I do not mind going to get the sign but the way he talked to me was totally unacceptable.
Sentence: I went to get the sign he marked down the price and while he was working on my transaction he received a phone call.
Sentence: He started talking to this person on the phone and was cursing that he had to get out of there by 9:30 because his ride would be outside.
Sentence: While he is cursing to his friend, he pick up that pen that is connected to the signing pad, slams it down and says "sign now", he then handed me my receipt and I said excuse me but can you give me a paid sticker, he replied very nasty "yeah" he put them on and then went to the next customer still talking on the phone.
Sentence: I have never experienced customer service like this before and I hope I never will again.
Sentence: I took down his name because I would hope this information gets passed to the District Manager of this area so they can talk to this cashier or train him on how to treat customers.
Sentence: His name was Raymond Cordova.
Sentence: I myself work in retail and if this happened in my facility I would be outraged.
Sentence: I don't believe you should have him on a register if that is how he treats people.
Sentence: You should value your customer's and appreciate their patronage by having friendly and courteous employees to make us want to come back to you.
Sentence: I hope this email does not get ignored, I was not the only upset customer in that line last night.
