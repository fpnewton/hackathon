      Thank you for the confirmation. I am a little confussed about the shipping.
      On the confirmation here is says available ship date 1-13-01, but I requested overnight shipping.
      I normally do not put rushes on packages, but   
      this one is so important. My grandfathers birthday is on Monday and I
      really want him to have this. I have been searching alot of Websites over   
      the last week and you were the only ones I found that had the button down   
      Cardigan. I know it is Saturday and I know no deliveries are made on   
      Sunday's but you should be able to overnight it today to be deliveried on   
      Monday. Please  
      
      Thank You,  
      Dawn
