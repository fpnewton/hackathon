I am a little confussed about the shipping.   On the confirmation here is says available ship date 1-13-01, but I   requested overnight shipping. I normally do not put rushes on packages, but   this one is so important. My grandfathers birthday is on Monday and I   really want him to have this. I have been searching alot of Websites over   the last week and you were the only ones I found that had the button down   Cardigan. I know it is Saturday and I know no deliveries are made on   Sunday's but you should be able to overnight it today to be deliveried on   Monday.

I have a complaint to file and believe this should be handled by corporate. I have already spoken to customer service and didn't receive satisfaction in their reply. I had recently worked in Macy's and found it to be a somewhat pleasing experience, but as far as my current concern, Macy's seems to be lacking customer respect. I think they need to keep in mind that I'm also a consumer, who wanted to support Macy's. I await your information.  x: 43  y: 9

I will call the Boca Raton store tomorrow. They will be less busy than    today, and the Executive Office staff will be present. I will reference  the date in the registry and the existance of a credit card charge.  If all else fails, the holder of the credit card can challenge the  purchase, through the credit card company. Of course, I hope it will not  come to that.  If you have the date of the credit card charge, that would help me a  great deal in pursuing this with the store. I will be here until 7:00 PM  tonight and tomorrow from 11:00 AM until 7:00 PM. Please do not put a  credit card number in an e-mail, for security reasons, but the exact  name on the card and/or the last 4 digits would be very helpful.

We did find out that Coila Longyear  purchased the 5 piece place setting through the Boca Raton  Bloomingdale's store.  She said her credit card has already been  charged.  We are still concerned because Jeff & I have NO record from  Bloomingdales, nor have we received the place setting.  Can you please    locate for us an order number & expected ship date so we have some type  of proof in the event that we do not receive this place setting?

I know you    were the person who helped us figure out the confusion with this  original order and, quite frankly, we're not sure what we would have  done without your help.  I am still rather confused about this missing    order & tomorrow, we will check with Jeff's family to see if we can't  find more out ourselves.  I couldn't do that with many of our guests but  b/c this is a gift from a family member, we're not too shy about asking.  By Sunday when you're back at work, maybe we'll have more information  for you.  Also, I believe the order from Coila Longyear was for 5 pieces, not 4. I  believe it was for a single entire place setting.  (Andrea Wilmoth's was  for four 5 piece place settings.)

I have just tried to reach you, by telephone,    and left a voicemail message.  If the order for the four pieces was made with a Bloomingdale's store, I  can follow up with the store. However, the only clue in our Purchase  List record is that the store notation was made on April 30, 2002.  From the store notation, my supervisor believes that Andrea Wilmoth or    Coila Longyear contacted the Boca Raton store, to report having  purchased the four pieces, elsewhere.

Our question, if you read the email we sent, is  pertaining to an order for a FIFTH place setting -- the order was placed  over the phone by Andrea Wilmoth but it was a gift from Coila Longyear,  my fiance's grandmother.  Andrea purchased the gift for Coila to assist  Coila.  As of right now, we are still missing any record of this order    -- we know from talking to Coila & Andrea that the order was placed  nearly one month ago.

Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Hi,  We are writing because we recently learned that a place setting of our    china was ordered over the phone several weeks ago.  We never received    any of the china (which we know is backordered), nor a notification of    the order.  In addition, our registry was not adjusted.  The gift was  from Coila Longyear (Jeff's grandmother) and was probably ordered by  Andrea Wilmoth.  Andrea said she ordered it by telephone quite some time  ago.  Would you be able to check into this for us?  We'd like some type of  written notification so we can track this order & have some type of  proof. I've already adjusted our registry myself.

We apologize for backordering the Miller-Rogaska "Soho" Decanter. I  believe we must have lost the confidence of Susan Lazerow, when we  informed her of the delay in the expected backorder due date. From the    order notes, I believe Ms. Lazerow canceled this order.  Unfortunately, Ms. Lazerow has not placed a replacement order, with us,  at this time.  We should normally be able to obtain the Miller-Rogaska "Soho" Decanter,  but I know we are currently experiencing delays from this vendor.  We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced. If you have any  further questions or concerns, please e-mail us at  Bloomingdalesregistry@fds.com or call us at: 1-888-269-3187.

Where do I go once I'm in the Macy's web page?  I click on women, then women   again for dresses.  Where are you cocktail dresses on your web site?  This   does not seem like a tough question.  But this is the third e-mail to you   asking you and same question.  The last answer, was that you were sorry I   could not find what I'm looking for.  This I know.  I just want to know how   to find the evening dresses for Macy's on the Internet.    Sincerely, Alice Nihil  
    Original Message Follows:  -------------------------      Form Message    ml_subject: Keep my email address private   Comment: Yesterday I purchased several items at two different counters.  I gave my social security number because I did not have my Macy's charge and wanted to charge the items.  When I arrived home, a woman had left a  message on my answering maching saying she had my social security number and that I should call her back at a designated telephone number.  I tried but her line was busy.  This morning the same woman called again and said she was calling about an outstanding balance from Chase Manhatten Bank that I had not paid in the amount of $6,000 and that it was long overdue.  I was going to have a lien against me.  She continued to say that she was authorized to settle the charge amount and even negotiate a lower amount if I would transfer the balance to another account.  She said I should give her the number of another credit card I had and she would take care of that transfer balance.  I told her I had already transfered that balance and that according to my records I owed Chase nothing.  She kept insisting that I did and that she could take care of it if I acted quickly and gave her the information she needed.  I hung up and called Chase Manhatten and they confirmed I owned nothing.    To make a long story short, I believe this woman was running a scam.  I reported it to the police and they belive that it is possible an employee from Macy's gave out my social security number to the woman running the scam.  They will investigate.  You may want to do the same.      The two counters I was at were the Clinique counter, and the Lagerdahl men's cologne counter.  I purchased things at both counters and had to give my social security number at each.  I was rather surprised at the time because Lord and Taylor and Nordstroms only requires the last four digits of the social security number to look up my charge card number.  Now I do not feel safe at all and am very hesitant to shop at Macy's ever again.

At that time I found it very difficult to "shop" back and forth   between selections and almost impossible to delete duplicate orders based   on size changes.  Good work! I have been in the parade since I was 3, and   now that I live in Nordstrom's territory I am glad to see that online   ordering seems to be working. I , would of course appreciate a "free   delivery" or discount coupon !!!    waitingwaiting@aol.com
