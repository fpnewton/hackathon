I have a complaint to file and believe this should be handled by corporate. I have already spoken to customer service and didn't receive satisfaction in their reply. I had recently worked in Macy's and found it to be a somewhat pleasing experience, but as far as my current concern, Macy's seems to be lacking customer respect. I think they need to keep in mind that I'm also a consumer, who wanted to support Macy's. I await your information.  x: 43  y: 9
