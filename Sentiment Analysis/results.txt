I am a little confussed about the shipping.
On the confirmation here is says available ship date 1-13-01, but I   requested overnight shipping.
I normally do not put rushes on packages, but   this one is so important.
My grandfathers birthday is on Monday and I   really want him to have this.
I have been searching alot of Websites over   the last week and you were the only ones I found that had the button down   Cardigan.
I know it is Saturday and I know no deliveries are made on   Sunday's but you should be able to overnight it today to be deliveried on   Monday.

ordernbr:   FirstName: William  LastName: Sgourdos  ZipCode: 07203  Comment: I would like the name and address for the President of Macy's.
I have a complaint to file and believe this should be handled by corporate.
I have already spoken to customer service and didn't receive satisfaction in their reply.
I had recently worked in Macy's and found it to be a somewhat pleasing experience, but as far as my current concern, Macy's seems to be lacking customer respect.
I think they need to keep in mind that I'm also a consumer, who wanted to support Macy's.
I await your information.

The problem was that the the gift total was correct and then there was a subtotal line that reflected the 9.95 shipping/handling fee so the columns were off.
Sorry for the confusion.

We did get a copy of the receipt from Coila -- she purchased the setting 4/30/02 (later than we originally thought) & the last four digits of the credit card are 0014 (VISA).
If you can, give us a call tomorrow and let us know if we can help more... we do have a faxed copy of Coila's receipt from the Boca store.
Thanks again,  Stacy         ----- Original Message -----  From: Bloomingdales Registry  Sent: Sunday, May 12, 2002 3:56 PM  To: Stacy Heiman  Subject: Re: Missing gift (KMMV35001L0KM)      Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding the gifts of Coila Longyear.
I will call the Boca Raton store tomorrow.
They will be less busy than    today, and the Executive Office staff will be present.
I will reference  the date in the registry and the existance of a credit card charge.
If all else fails, the holder of the credit card can challenge the  purchase, through the credit card company.
Of course, I hope it will not  come to that.
If you have the date of the credit card charge, that would help me a  great deal in pursuing this with the store.
I will be here until 7:00 PM  tonight and tomorrow from 11:00 AM until 7:00 PM.
Please do not put a  credit card number in an e-mail, for security reasons, but the exact  name on the card and/or the last 4 digits would be very helpful.
If you have any further questions or concerns, please e-mail us at   or call us at: 1-.

Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Hi Tony,  Thank you for your response.
We did find out that Coila Longyear  purchased the 5 piece place setting through the Boca Raton  Bloomingdale's store.
She said her credit card has already been  charged.
We are still concerned because Jeff & I have NO record from  Bloomingdales, nor have we received the place setting.
Can you please    locate for us an order number & expected ship date so we have some type  of proof in the event that we do not receive this place setting?
We did notice that you have adjusted our registry accordingly.
Thanks    again for your continued help.

I apologize.
I missed the fifth piece of the 5-Piece Place Setting.
We    do show 5 purchases by Coila Longyear, and four 5-Piece Place Settings    purchased by Andrea Wilmoth.
I am pleased you will be able to do some  more research on this situation.
If you find that the purchase was  through Bloomingdale's, please let me know what you learn, and I will  resolve any open issues.

Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Tony,  I received your message and truly appreciate your efforts.
I know you    were the person who helped us figure out the confusion with this  original order and, quite frankly, we're not sure what we would have  done without your help.
I am still rather confused about this missing    order & tomorrow, we will check with Jeff's family to see if we can't  find more out ourselves.
I couldn't do that with many of our guests but  b/c this is a gift from a family member, we're not too shy about asking.
By Sunday when you're back at work, maybe we'll have more information  for you.
Also, I believe the order from Coila Longyear was for 5 pieces, not 4.
I  believe it was for a single entire place setting.
(Andrea Wilmoth's was  for four 5 piece place settings.)
Thanks so much,  Stacy  ----- Original Message -----  From: Bloomingdales Registry  Sent: Friday, May 10, 2002 5:03 PM  To: Stacy Heiman  Subject: Re: Missing gift (KMMV63305L0KM)  Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding order #  W.
I have just tried to reach you, by telephone,    and left a voicemail message.
If the order for the four pieces was made with a Bloomingdale's store, I  can follow up with the store.
However, the only clue in our Purchase  List record is that the store notation was made on April 30, 2002.
From the store notation, my supervisor believes that Andrea Wilmoth or    Coila Longyear contacted the Boca Raton store, to report having  purchased the four pieces, elsewhere.
I have coded this e-mail to reply to my attention.
I will be in the  office Sunday through Wednesday, this week.
We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced.
If you have any  further questions or concerns, please e-mail us at   or call us at: 1-.

Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  I just checked the order number referenced in your email against our  records -- this is NOT the order we were asking about.
According to our  records, order # W is from Andrea Wilmoth for 4  place settings.
Our question, if you read the email we sent, is  pertaining to an order for a FIFTH place setting -- the order was placed  over the phone by Andrea Wilmoth but it was a gift from Coila Longyear,  my fiance's grandmother.
Andrea purchased the gift for Coila to assist  Coila.
As of right now, we are still missing any record of this order    -- we know from talking to Coila & Andrea that the order was placed  nearly one month ago.
Please help us to locate this single place  setting order.

Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Hi,  We are writing because we recently learned that a place setting of our    china was ordered over the phone several weeks ago.
We never received    any of the china (which we know is backordered), nor a notification of    the order.
In addition, our registry was not adjusted.
The gift was  from Coila Longyear (Jeff's grandmother) and was probably ordered by  Andrea Wilmoth.
Andrea said she ordered it by telephone quite some time  ago.
Would you be able to check into this for us?
We'd like some type of  written notification so we can track this order & have some type of  proof.
I've already adjusted our registry myself.

(KMMV24 (KMMV98171L0KM)  Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding order #  W.
We apologize for backordering the Miller-Rogaska "Soho" Decanter.
I  believe we must have lost the confidence of Susan Lazerow, when we  informed her of the delay in the expected backorder due date.
From the    order notes, I believe Ms. Lazerow canceled this order.
Unfortunately, Ms. Lazerow has not placed a replacement order, with us,  at this time.
We should normally be able to obtain the Miller-Rogaska "Soho" Decanter,  but I know we are currently experiencing delays from this vendor.
We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced.
If you have any  further questions or concerns, please e-mail us at   or call us at: 1-.
Our office  hours are Monday through Saturday 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM EST and Sunday  11:00 AM to 10:00 PM EST.

*******************************************  So, does this mean Susan Lazerow repurchased anything or that, as of  now=  , no gift has been purchased by her?
I had already written Susan a  thank=  you note, having NO idea from Bloomingdale's that the order was  cancelled=  d -- how was I to know?
I had received 3 emails confirming this order.
=  If, as I understand it, the Soho Decanter has NOT been ordered, then I    am=  going to remove it from the registry altogether.
Also, I must say, we are not feeling too confident with everything that  i=  s going on through the Bloomingdale's registry... if we are to continue  u=  sing Bloomingdales online, we have GOT to start getting the correct and  c=  omplete information -- we want our guests to receive prompt thank you  not=  es (regardless of something backordered or not) and we do not want them  t=  o go through any unnecessary hassles.
We do, however, appreciate your  tho=  rough responses to our emails.

(KMMV24855L0KM)  =20  Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding order #  W.  Unfortunately, as of April 12, 2002, this order was canceled, at the  request of the purchaser, Susan Lazerow, and your registry was updated    =20  to show the Miller-Rogaska "Soho" Decanter as available for purchase.
Prior to cancelation, the gift was shown a being on indefinite  backorder.

We did get a copy of the receipt from Coila -- she purchased the setting 4/30/02 (later than we originally thought) & the last four digits of the credit card are 0014 (VISA).
If you can, give us a call tomorrow and let us know if we can help more... we do have a faxed copy of Coila's receipt from the Boca store.
Thanks again,  Stacy         ----- Original Message -----  From: Bloomingdales Registry  Sent: Sunday, May 12, 2002 3:56 PM  To: Stacy Heiman  Subject: Re: Missing gift (KMMV35001L0KM)      Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding the gifts of Coila Longyear.
I will call the Boca Raton store tomorrow.
They will be less busy than    today, and the Executive Office staff will be present.
I will reference  the date in the registry and the existance of a credit card charge.
If all else fails, the holder of the credit card can challenge the  purchase, through the credit card company.
Where do I go once I'm in the Macy's web page?
Of course, I hope it will not  come to that.
I click on women, then women   again for dresses.
If you have the date of the credit card charge, that would help me a  great deal in pursuing this with the store.
Where are you cocktail dresses on your web site?
I will be here until 7:00 PM  tonight and tomorrow from 11:00 AM until 7:00 PM.
This   does not seem like a tough question.
Please do not put a  credit card number in an e-mail, for security reasons, but the exact  name on the card and/or the last 4 digits would be very helpful.
But this is the third e-mail to you   asking you and same question.
If you have any further questions or concerns, please e-mail us at   or call us at: 1-.
The last answer, was that you were sorry I   could not find what I'm looking for.
Our office  hours are Monday through Saturday 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM EST and Sunday  11:00 AM to 10:00 PM EST.
This I know.
I just want to know how   to find the evening dresses for Macy's on the Internet.
I gave my social security number because I did not have my Macy's charge and wanted to charge the items.
Sincerely,  Tony Fairhead    Internet Customer Service  http://Bloomingdales.WeddingChannel.com
When I arrived home, a woman had left a  message on my answering maching saying she had my social security number and that I should call her back at a designated telephone number.

"It's like no other Registry in the World."
I tried but her line was busy.
Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  Hi Tony,  Thank you for your response.
We did find out that Coila Longyear  purchased the 5 piece place setting through the Boca Raton  Bloomingdale's store.
This morning the same woman called again and said she was calling about an outstanding balance from Chase Manhatten Bank that I had not paid in the amount of $6,000 and that it was long overdue.
She said her credit card has already been  charged.
I was going to have a lien against me.
We are still concerned because Jeff & I have NO record from  Bloomingdales, nor have we received the place setting.
She continued to say that she was authorized to settle the charge amount and even negotiate a lower amount if I would transfer the balance to another account.
Can you please    locate for us an order number & expected ship date so we have some type  of proof in the event that we do not receive this place setting?
She said I should give her the number of another credit card I had and she would take care of that transfer balance.
We did notice that you have adjusted our registry accordingly.
I told her I had already transfered that balance and that according to my records I owed Chase nothing.
WALLACE    YOUR NUMBERS ARE STILL INCORRECT.
Thanks    again for your continued help.
She kept insisting that I did and that she could take care of it if I acted quickly and gave her the information she needed.
THE GIFT BEING $29.99 LESS 15% = $25.49
Stacy  ----- Original Message -----  From: Bloomingdales Registry  Sent: Sunday, May 12, 2002 2:27 PM  To: Stacy Heiman  Subject: Re: Missing gift (KMMV51515L0KM)  Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding the gifts of Coila Longyear.
I hung up and called Chase Manhatten and they confirmed I owned nothing.
- SHIPPING IS INCLUDED.
I apologize.
To make a long story short, I believe this woman was running a scam.
IF YOU ALREADY PUT THE CHARGE THROUGH FOR $55.21 -  YOU NEED TO PUT THRU THE ENTIRE CREDIT OF $29.72.
I missed the fifth piece of the 5-Piece Place Setting.
I reported it to the police and they belive that it is possible an employee from Macy's gave out my social security number to the woman running the scam.
We    do show 5 purchases by Coila Longyear, and four 5-Piece Place Settings    purchased by Andrea Wilmoth.
DID YOU ALREADY PUT A  CHARGE THROUGH ON MY CREDIT CARD?
They will investigate.
I am pleased you will be able to do some  more research on this situation.
PLEASE MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT IMMEDIATELY.
You may want to do the same.
If you find that the purchase was  through Bloomingdale's, please let me know what you learn, and I will  resolve any open issues.
MRS.
The two counters I was at were the Clinique counter, and the Lagerdahl men's cologne counter.
We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced.
There was star next to the item indicating it was a Macy's double bonus rebate item.

I printed out the coupon and the coupon is for a food processor.
I was rather surprised at the time because Lord and Taylor and Nordstroms only requires the last four digits of the social security number to look up my charge card number.
The items is on  > sale for  $29.99.

Now I do not feel safe at all and am very hesitant to shop at Macy's ever again.
We will credit your account for the difference.

I am confident you will be able to handle this matter yourself or arrange for its handling.
The total for your order is $ 55.21.
I have just tried to reach you, by telephone,    and left a voicemail message.
Please contact me when you have completed the following:    We registered for the Analon Professional 12-Piece Set at the store and asked our Bridal Registry associate to break down the set into the individual pots/pans.

If the order for the four pieces was made with a Bloomingdale's store, I  can follow up with the store.
Niether the set nor any pots/pans in the set have been added to the on-line registry listing.

From the store notation, my supervisor believes that Andrea Wilmoth or    Coila Longyear contacted the Boca Raton store, to report having  purchased the four pieces, elsewhere.

Please advise.
(KMMV24 (KMMV98171L0KM)  Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding order #  W.
We apologize for backordering the Miller-Rogaska "Soho" Decanter.

I  believe we must have lost the confidence of Susan Lazerow, when we  informed her of the delay in the expected backorder due date.

From the    order notes, I believe Ms. Lazerow canceled this order.
Unfortunately, Ms. Lazerow has not placed a replacement order, with us,  at this time.

(KMMV24855L0KM)  =20  Dear Stacy Heiman,  Thank you for your recent e-mail regarding order #  W.  Unfortunately, as of April 12, 2002, this order was canceled, at the  request of the purchaser, Susan Lazerow, and your registry was updated    =20  to show the Miller-Rogaska "Soho" Decanter as available for purchase.
Prior to cancelation, the gift was shown a being on indefinite  backorder.
This would be a likely cause of a cancelation.

At that time I found it very difficult to "shop" back and forth   between selections and almost impossible to delete duplicate orders based   on size changes.
Good work!
I have been in the parade since I was 3, and   now that I live in Nordstrom's territory I am glad to see that online   ordering seems to be working.
I , would of course appreciate a "free   delivery" or discount coupon !!!

Jen Ertman  Original Message Follows:  -------------------------  My fiancé and I were wanting to register for some electronics from the Bon  Marche.
When we were in the store, we were told that you had to do this  online as they do not have electronics in all stores.
On the website, I do  not see any electronics...can you help?
